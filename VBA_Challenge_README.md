# Green Energy Stock Analysis with VBA

## Purpose and Background
The purpose of this code is to analyze stocks from green energy companies for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, so that Steve can recommend his clients the best companies to buy stocks in. 
## Comparing Stock Performance: 2017 to 2018
Many of the green energy companies that Steve listed had worsening returns from 2017 to 2018. I would recommend that Steve look at SPWR over DQ, since they had a 21% increase from 2017 to 2018, while DQ had a 260% decrease in their returns. I would not recommend the companies that had large decreases in their total volume (i.e., 101.3% positive returns in 2017 and 39.7% negative returns in 2018 for FSLR): DQ, FSLR, JKS, and SEDG. 
To best diversify Steve’s clients’ portfolios, Steve should look into RUN, SWPR, and TERP.
## Code Analysis
The original VBA code has a run time of 0.5664062 seconds for both 2017 and 2018, which indicates that the code is likely not differentiating from the two fiscal years. The refactored code is faster due to multiple for-loops and succinct phrasing.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Refactoring Code Generally
The advantages of refactoring code include efficiency, readability, and better understanding of the code itself. Conversely, refactoring code takes additional time beyond what the programmer has already completed and therefore, more money (either from the programmer themselves or the company).
## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored VBA Script 
The advantages of the original VBA script is that I had a better immediate grasp of the code because I wrote it; on the other hand, it was terribly inefficient and did not produce both 2017 and 2018 results. The refactored VBA script, therefore, was more complicated because someone else wrote it, but it is far more effective.
